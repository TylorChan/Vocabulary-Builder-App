## Need to be Done

- Add 'Unsaved' function
- Investigate how to use [Chatkit](https://github.com/openai/openai-chatkit-advanced-samples) in my second AI-chat (
  Voice Agent) interface.
- LLM-based forgetting curve for review session
- Backend migration (node.js -> springboot) for **Deepgram** and **Gemini**
- Increase transcription display length to prevent missing words during selection.
- Bold the selected word in definitions and example sentences for better visibility.
